# Scientific Foreknowledge in the Bible

Biblical scientific foreknowledge refers to information foudn in the Bible on a scientific level that was unknown at the time of the writing of the text. While we recognize that the Bible was not written for the purpose of being a "science book," this recognition does not preclude that no scientific information can be found there. The purpose of this consideration is to supply one with sufficient evidence that the Bible was inspired of God, the Creator of All. Yes, the Bible does claim to be inspired by God. **2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:20-21; 1 Corinthians 2:12-13**. Either the Biblical writers were deluded, deceitful, or inspired of God. There were about 40 biblical writers who wrote over a span of some 1500 years. Could the deluded create such a masterpiece? Could the deceitful work together for 1500 years? Could God speak to us? Dr. Henry M. Morris said it well:

> One of the most arresting evidences of the inspiration of the Bible is the great number of scientific truths that have lain hidden within its pages for thirty centuries or more, only to be discovered by man's enterprise within the last few centuries or even years (The Bible and Modern Science, Moody, Chicago, 1969, p 5).

## _"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."_
### Genesis 1:1

Near the close of his life, Herbert-Spencer (1820-1903), a British philosopher, concluded that there are five basic fundamentals of science: **time, force, action, space** and **matter**. Moses's writing in the above verse, the very first verse of the Bible, declares the same princicples. "In the beginning (time) God (force) created (action) the heavens (space) and the earth (matter)." Moses lived about 3,000 years before Herbert Spencer. Moses probably did not know as he wrote Genesis 1:1 that such scientific truth was present within the verse, but God who inspired him certainly did.

# Oceanography

## _"...Whatever passes through the paths of the seas"_
### Psalms 8:8

Matthew Fontaine Maury (1806-1873) once noticed this verse while confined to his bed with a lengthy illness. After noticing the phrase "paths of the seas," he decided to find them. He was the first to recognize that the water of the seas circulated in paths working in unison with the wind. His text on physical oceanography is a basic text for these studies. In 1927, the United States Naval Institute issued a book called _Matthew Fontaine Maury: Pathfinder of the Seas_. It tells his story of his discovery. There is a statue in Virginia in his honor with **Psalm 8:8** carved in its base. It also says "Maury took God at His Word and found that Word to be fully accurate." How do you suppose that David, the Psalmist, wrote about the paths of the seas?

## "Have you entered into the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep?"
### Job 38:16

This verse records God's response to Job. Job is believed to have lived even before Moses. It is an interesting question God asks Job. He refers to the "springs of the sea." The earliest secular reference to these sub-marine springs was written by a Roman geographer named Strabo (63 B.C. - A.D. 21). Today, we know that they exist off the coasts of Greece, Italy, Israel, and Syria. Fresh water can be found in the sea off the coast of Austrailia in great quantity. Also, the U.S. Geological Survey from 1976 found fresh water in the Atlantic between New England and Georgia. How did the writer of Job know of such things?

God also referred to the "recesses of the deep." There is a similar reference by David in **2 Samuel 22:16**. David refers to "channels of the sea." For a long time man thought that the sea was shallow. It was not until the Challenger expedition (1873-1876) that these "recesses" were discovered. The expedition discovered a canyon in the Pacific 5 1/2 miles deep. Many others have been found since. Near the Phillipines, one has been found almost 7 miles deep! How could this have been known during the time of the writing of Job?

## "All the rivers flow into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again..."
### Ecclesiastes 1:7

## "If the clouds are full, they pour out rain upon the earth."
### Ecclesiastes 11:3

## "The One who builds His upper chambers in the heavens, and has founded his vaulted dome over the earth, He who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out on the face of the earth, the Lord is His name."
### Amos 9:6

This all sounds pretty basic to mankind today. However, man's understanding of the hydrologic cycle was not present or accepted until the late sixteenth century and early seventeenth century. The initial evidence of the complete water cycle came from the experiments of Pierre Perrault and Edme Mariotte 2000 years later! Also, Edmund Halley, an astronomer, provided data regarding the concept of a water cycle. Isn't it interesting that the scriptures indicated a water cycle long before modern science caught up? Isn'it it reasonable to conclude that a Creator knows of His creation? Scripture, the Creator's shared Word with mankind, does not conflict with science. It does, however, conflict with poor science and has been proven correct over and over.

# Medicine

## "For the life of the flesh is in the blood"
### Leviticus 17:11

Moses was scientifically correct. Red blood cells carry oxygen through the body. Without this, life would not exist. We have this knowledge today but certainly not in Moses's time. You may recall that our first president, George Washington, died following the medical process of blood-letting. It was believed that a sickness was caused by bad blood and the blood had to be removed in order for life to continue. Do you wonder if the arrogance of the medical professionals of that century would have scoffed if someone had suggested that the Bible may give information conflicting with their "advanced" views?

## " And every male among you who is eight days old shall be circumcised..."
### Genesis 17:12

Why did God prescribe circumcision to be performed on the eigth day after birth? In 1935, Professor H. Dam gave the name for "vitamin K". Vitamin K is necessary for proper blood-clotting. Vitamin K is necessary for the production of propthrombin by the liver. It is not until the 5th through the 7th day after the birth of a male that vitamin K begins to be produced in the body. It is on the eigth day after birth that prothrombin rises to 100% sufficiency in the male body! From that day on, prothrombin is not to that level again. Only on day eight is it that high!The most healthy time to perform circumcisian is on day eight. Day eight gives the least chance for hemorrhaging.

## "...and between your seed and her seed..."
### Genesis 3:15

Here, the Lord reveals that the male and female possess the "seed of life." Ancient writers believed that only the male possessed the seed of life. Today, we know that it requires the 23 chromosomes found in the female ovum plus the 23 chromosomes found in the male sperm to produce a normal human child.

## "Then the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breathe of life, and man became a living being."
### Genesis 2:7

It has generall always been known that when humans die, their body returns to dust. It makes sense since that is what we were created from. It is becoming more and more "scientific" to believe that there is a spiritual aspect to humanity. The above verse says that we became a living being or soul. **Genesis 1:27** says that God created man in His own image. God is Spirit. Mankind has been given a spirit which cannot be destroyed like the human body. Various cultures have always recognized this. Now, our culture is recognizing this fact more and more.
