# Scientific Foreknowledge in the Bible

Biblical scientific foreknowledge refers to information foudn in the Bible on a scientific level that was unknown at the time of the writing of the text. While we recognize that the Bible was not written for the purpose of being a "science book," this recognition does not preclude that no scientific information can be found there. The purpose of this consideration is to supply one with sufficient evidence that the Bible was inspired of God, the Creator of All. Yes, the Bible does claim to be inspired by God. **2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:20-21; 1 Corinthians 2:12-13**. Either the Biblical writers were deluded, deceitful, or inspired of God. There were about 40 biblical writers who wrote over a span of some 1500 years. Could the deluded create such a masterpiece? Could the deceitful work together for 1500 years? Could God speak to us? Dr. Henry M. Morris said it well:

> One of the most arresting evidences of the inspiration of the Bible is the great number of scientific truths that have lain hidden within its pages for thirty centuries or more, only to be discovered by man's enterprise within the last few centuries or even years (The Bible and Modern Science, Moody, Chicago, 1969, p 5).

## _"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."_
### Genesis 1:1

Near the close of his life, Herbert-Spencer (1820-1903), a British philosopher, concluded that there are five basic fundamentals of science: **time, force, action, space** and **matter**. Moses's writing in the above verse, the very first verse of the Bible, declares the same princicples. "In the beginning (time) God (force) created (action) the heavens (space) and the earth (matter)." Moses lived about 3,000 years before Herbert Spencer. Moses probably did not know as he wrote Genesis 1:1 that such scientific truth was present within the verse, but God who inspired him certainly did.

## _"...Whatever passes through the paths of the seas"_
### Psalms 8:8

Matthew Fontaine Maury (1806-1873) once noticed this verse while confined to his bed with a lengthy illness. After noticing the phrase "paths of the seas," he decided to find them. He was the first to recognize that the water of the seas circulated in paths working in unison with the wind. His text on physical oceanography is a basic text for these studies. In 1927, the United States Naval Institute issued a book called _Matthew Fontaine Maury: Pathfinder of the Seas_. It tells his story of his discovery. There is a statue in Virginia in his honor with **Psalm 8:8** carved in its base. It also says "Maury took God at His Word and found that Word to be fully accurate." How do you suppose that David, the Psalmist, wrote about the paths of the seas?
